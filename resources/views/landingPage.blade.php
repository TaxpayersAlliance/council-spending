	<hr>

	<p>Taxpayers have a right to know how the government is spending their money. Taxpayers data is a collection of APIs that allow users to find out precisely this.</p>
	<p>Included is the Council Spending API - an archive of historic TaxPayers' Alliance research into county and district authorities. You can find more information on how to use the data on the <a href="https://github.com/TaxpayersAlliance/council-spending" target="_blank">council spending repository</a>.</p>
